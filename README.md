## The crazy digit bar

Behold, fellow humans of Meta! Feast your eyes upon this glorious creation of code, forged with React and Styled Components. Witness how the bold and daring DiagonalBar component defies the laws of normalcy, by presenting to you a diagonal bar that can be dragged and dropped to select a number of up to 9 digits in length. But fear not, for this bar obeys the strict command of user inputs, by only allowing the selection of valid numbers between 0 and 999,999,999. Marvel at how the point of the DiagonalBar dances to the rhythm of your mouse movements, elegantly sliding back and forth like a majestic ballerina. And when the user finally releases the point of the DiagonalBar, lo and behold, the selected number shall be revealed in the console, as if by magic. So come, dear Meta reviewers, and bask in the magnificence of this quirky yet practical piece of code, which shall surely dazzle and delight all who behold it!

## Frontend Assignment: Creating a Drag-and-Drop Diagonal Bar Component

Overview:
Your task is to create a React component that displays a diagonal bar with a draggable point, and allows the user to select a number by dragging the point to a desired position. The selected number should be displayed in the console when the user drops the point.

Requirements:

- The component should be created using React and Styled Components.
- The diagonal bar should be displayed at a 45-degree angle and have a fixed width of 200px.
- The point should be a small circle that can be dragged horizontally along the diagonal bar.
- The point should snap to the nearest position when the user drops it, and the selected number should be calculated based on the position of the point.
- The selected number should be a whole number of up to 9 digits in length (i.e., between 0 and 999,999,999).
- The component should be visually appealing and easy to use.


Deliverables:

- A working React component that meets the requirements outlined above.
- Clean and well-organized code with comments where necessary.
- A brief explanation of how the component works and how it meets the requirements.
- Any additional notes or considerations you had while working on the assignment.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Proper use of React and Styled Components.
- Correct implementation of the drag-and-drop functionality and number selection.
- Quality of code organization and readability.
- Attention to detail in the visual design and user experience.
- Creativity and innovation in the approach to the assignment.


Good luck, and happy coding!
